## Description



## Usage

### Data file format

Please see a sample data file [here](https://github.com/mdphan/GrowthCurvesAnalysis_shinyApp/blob/master/sample_data.txt).

- The data should be blank corrected (automatically calculated by most plate readers)
- The file should be in tab-delimited format (can be exported from Excel)
- The first column contains strain/group names. Replicates of the same strain/group should have the same name
- The first row contains time variable
- The remaining row contains growth measurements (usually OD600) for growth curve, one curve per row (one replicate of a group)

### Growth curve plot

### Curve parameter estimation

### Statistical comparisons
